#+PROPERTY: LOGGING nil

# Note: This readme works with the org-make-toc <https://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc> package, which automatically updates the table of contents.

This package makes use of clj-kondo's analysis data to provide code editing facilities related to Clojure, ClojureScript and cljc source. This means you get advanced editing features like auto-complete without the need for a connected REPL, because clj-kondo performs its magic using static source code analysis.

Currently, it gives you contextual auto-completion using completion-at-point, which works without a REPL connected, since it relies on clj-kondo's static source analysis. It will list out all available Vars, Ns and Aliases in a given buffer. 

It supports the notion of projects, using projectile and Clojure's tools.deps. This means it'll pick up the buffer's current project root using projectile, and it will use Clojure's tools.deps to get the project's classpath. If it can't find either, it'll only auto-complete within the buffer, it won't be able to show candidates from the required dependencies.

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0

** Prerequisites

Anakondo needs the Clojure CLI tools.deps and clj-kondo to be installed and accessible from Emacs in order to run properly. To do so:

1. Install clj-kondo by following its [[https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/install.md][install instructions]].
2. Make sure =clj-kondo= is in your shell's ~PATH~.
3. Install the Clojure CLI tools.deps by following its [[https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools][install instruction]].
4. Make sure the =clojure= CLI is in your shell's ~PATH~.
5. Now proceed with one of the following strategies to install the anakondo package in your Emacs.

** MELPA

Not in MELPA yet, but should be coming soon.

** Manual

1. Clone this repo somewhere on your computer.
2. Make sure that somewhere is in your Emacs ~load-path~.
3. Now put this in your init file:
   + If you want to pre-load it:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Load anakondo to make available its minor mode in clojure buffers
(require 'anakondo)
#+END_SRC
   + If you want to lazy load it:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Delays loading of anakondo until a clojure buffer is used
(autoload 'anakondo-minor-mode "anakondo")
#+END_SRC

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

Turn on anakondo minor mode in one or more Clojure, ClojureScript or cljc buffer:

+ ~anakondo-minor-mode~ : Turn on/off anakondo minor mode in current buffer.

Run one of these commands:

  + ~completion-at-point~ : Will auto-complete symbol at point using clj-kondo's static analysis, no repl needed
  + ~complete-symbol~ : Will auto-complete symbol at point using clj-kondo's static analysis, no repl needed
  + ~anakondo-refresh-project-cache~ : Refresh the anakondo project analysis cache

To have it on by default for all your Clojure, ClojureScript and cljc buffers, add to your Emacs init file, after the anakondo require/autoload:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Enable anakondo-minor-mode in all Clojure buffers
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'anakondo-minor-mode)
;; Enable anakondo-minor-mode in all ClojureScript buffers
(add-hook 'clojurescript-mode-hook #'anakondo-minor-mode)
;; Enable anakondo-minor-mode in all cljc buffers
(add-hook 'clojurec-mode-hook #'anakondo-minor-mode)
#+end_src

If you are also using Cider, the order in which you add the hooks matters in the resulting completion behavior:

1. If you add anakondo to the Clojure mode hooks first, then completion will first try to use anakondo's, and only if it can't complete the form will it then try to use Cider's completion. This means if you try to complete a keyword for example, it'll fallback to Cider's, but for completing symbols it won't, even if it finds no candidates.
2. Otherwise, if you add Cider to the Clojure mode hooks first, then completion will first try to use Cider's, and only if Cider completion is not available, because there is no connected REPL, will it then fallback to try anakondo's completion. If Cider completion is available (because you have a REPL connected), it will never fallback to trying anakondo's completion, even if Cider doesn't find and completion candidates.

*Currently, I recommend adding anakondo after Cider*. This will make it so when no REPL is connected, you have anakondo's clj-kondo based static analysis completion. While when a REPL is running, you have Cider's completion, which currently gives you more information and includes locals and java classes. If you do it the other way around, when a REPL is running, if anakondo find completions you will only see the ones it found, which would be missing local bindings and java classes. I'll be exploring options to have the completions merged in the future, so we get the best of both worlds.

This also goes if you turn on/off the modes manually, except in that case, order and effect are reversed. The last mode you turn on will be the one who is in charge of completion first. While with the hooks, it is the first mode you add to the hook that will be in charge of completion first.

** Tips

+ When you first turn on the minor mode, it will do an initial analysis of the full projectile project associated with your buffer with the classpath as defined by =tools.deps=. This can take a few seconds. This will happen for every projectile project you turn on the mode in a buffer for, but won't happen again when turning on the mode in another buffer in the same projectile project.
+ If you change your =deps.edn=, or feel the completion is looking out of sync, you can force refresh the cache of the project analysis by running: =M-x anakondo-refresh-project-cache= command.
+ If dependency completion isn't working, remember that =anakondo= only supports =tools.deps= for now, if you don't have a =deps.edn= for your project, it will pick up your global =deps.edn= instead, it won't use your lein =project.clj= or boot =build.boot= dependencies.
+ If you've disabled cider-mode, and somehow anakondo completion stopped working, this is because of a known bug in cider-mode, which removes all configured completion for the buffer, not just its own, I am trying to get this fixed in cider as well.
+ If you've killed the REPL, and somehow anakonda completion doesn't seem to be picking it back up, this is also due to a bug in cider, where it deletes all configured completion for the buffer on repl quit. I am trying to get this fixed in cider as well.

** 0.1

Additions
+ Added ~anakondo-minor-mode~ command which lets you turn on/off clj-kondo driven auto-completion in your buffer
+ Clj-kondo auto-completion added to Emacs ~completion-at-point~
+ Contextual auto-completion, it only lists Vars which are required in current buffer
+ Auto-completes namespaces as well
+ If a required ns has an alias, only completes with alias to avoid accidentally forgetting to use alias
+ Properly handles Clojure, ClojureScript and cljc buffers with no associated file
+ Defaults to =user= namespace if there are no ~ns~ form in buffer
+ Added ~anakondo-refresh-project-cache~ command which lets you refresh the cache when you've modified your project classpath
+ Supports company-mode through company-capf backend
+ Anakondo minor mode lighter is user customizable, defaults to " k"

Internal
+ Clj-kondo analysis is now cached for better performance
+ Project level analysis done synchronously once on mode enter and cached for later use
+ Uses projectile to find the project root
+ Uses tools.deps to find the classpath for project root
+ On completion, re-analyses the current buffer and updates cache
+ Handles finding the symbol to complete even in complex forms like src_clojure{~sym}, src_clojure{~@sym}, src_clojure{@sym}, src_clojure{'sym}, src_clojure{`sym}, etc.

* Roadmap

+ Fix bug where sym/ says No matching candidates instead of listing the available candidates that begin with sym/

* Credits

This package would not have been possible without the following packages:
+ [[https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo][clj-kondo]] : which does all the heavy lifting
+ [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] : which gives Emacs a common notion of projects
+ [[https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha][tools.deps]] : which lets me find the classpath effortlessly
+ [[https://github.com/ryancrum/json.el][json :]] which lets me parse clj-kondo's analysis file inside Emacs

Thanks to all of them and their author/contributors.
